AI-Powered Data Query Dashboard

ðŸš€ Project Overview

This is a React-based dashboard prototype designed for a Gen AI Analytics Tool that allows non-technical users to query data using natural language. The system processes user queries, simulates fetching results, and visualizes data with charts.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

Natural Language Query Input: Users can type questions to retrieve insights.

Query Processing Simulation: Mocks AI-powered responses.

Results Visualization: Displays processed data in a chart format.

Query History: Users can track past queries.

State Management: Uses Redux for handling queries and results.

Modern UI: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.


ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS

State Management: Redux Toolkit

Chart Visualization: Recharts
